Steps to Make Katori Chaat
Step 1: Prepare the Katoris
Mix the Dough: Combine the all-purpose flour, semolina, and oil/ghee in a mixing bowl. Gradually add water and knead into a firm dough. Cover and set it aside for 15-20 minutes.
Shape the Katoris: Divide the dough into small balls. Roll out each ball into a thin disc. Place the disc over a metal or silicone bowl (katori) and press gently to shape it.
Fry or Bake the Katoris:
To fry, heat oil in a deep pan. Fry the dough-covered bowls until golden brown and crispy. Remove and drain on paper towels.
To bake, preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Place the dough-covered bowls on a baking tray and bake for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.
Step 2: Prepare the Filling
Mix Vegetables and Spices: In a large bowl, combine the boiled potatoes, chickpeas, onions, tomatoes, coriander leaves, and pomegranate seeds. Add chaat masala, salt, and red chili powder to taste. Toss everything gently to mix well.
Step 3: Assemble the Katori Chaat
Fill the Katoris: Take the prepared katoris and fill them with the vegetable and chickpea mixture.
Add Yogurt and Chutneys: Drizzle whisked yogurt over the filling. Add tamarind chutney and green chutney as per your taste preference.
Garnish: Sprinkle sev on top for an added crunch. You can also add a bit more coriander leaves for garnish.
